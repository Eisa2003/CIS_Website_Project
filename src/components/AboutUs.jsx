      <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p> Thanks to funding from the Coastal Carolina Foundation, this online resource center was created by 
            Communities In Schools of South Carolina (CISSC) in conjunction with the University of South Carolina Beaufort (USCB) 
            to help the citizens of Hampton County identify and access needed services and resources.  This project was started by 
            the Hampton County Coalition, 
            and we would especially like to thank 
            Trina Williams with the New Life Center for her many hours of work compiling these resources.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>We hope to continually update and improve this website and welcome your feedback as one way we will improve.
